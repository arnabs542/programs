=== STRING Problems Notes ===

# VERY IMPORTANT !! Get Clear understanding of
  => Permutation & Combination strings notes refer to PERMUTE_vs_COMBINATE.txt and also following problems:
  => com.raj.recursion.combinations.Subsets
  => com.raj.recursion.permutations.Permute

# Complexity of String append ?
append is O(n) in Java/Python due to immutability but O(1) in C++
for (i=0 to n) print("Hello" + "World"); // O(n^2)

# When you are trying to determine a SUB-SEQUENCE, most likely it's a DP problem
  => subseq starting with 'a' in 'abcd' => ab..,ac..,ad.. (3 choices to make - exponential, recursion, overlapping subproblems)

# INTUITIONS for String related problems
  => "Enumerate all substrings" from left to right fixing each char from left ... O(n^2)
  => If it's subsequence etc, try "enumerate all subsets"
  => Try formulating a "recursive approach" where u solve a smaller problem & recurse on remaining, identify base case
     => Go "DP table" bottom up or DP top down memoization
  => Try "iterate differently from R->L or Mid" instead of regular left to right
     => Mid element expansion ? Try fixing a char from left & expand going left & right simultaneously
     => For even length just set left & right ptrs adjacent
  => Tries (Prefix searches only)
  => Suffix Trees (any substr search including prefixes)
