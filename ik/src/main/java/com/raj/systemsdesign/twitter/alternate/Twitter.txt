Microservices:
* Tweets
* Timeline (Home, User)
* Trends
* Search

Estimates:
300M users
1000 write qps/sec
1,000,000 read qps/sec

* Trending Service:
  -> Real time streaming pipeline like storm will do counts for hashtags(removing words like is, was, they etc) every 5 mins
  -> It can store those increments to figure out the trending topics, if it's significantly higher than last few intervals
     - or use count-min-sketch to do counts in place with some over counting
     - then the largest increase over the previous time point is reported as trend.
     - This approach can be refined by using exponentially weighted moving averages and variance for normalization
  -> Or better do a "z-score" for each topic using formula = (x - mean)/(standard deviation)
