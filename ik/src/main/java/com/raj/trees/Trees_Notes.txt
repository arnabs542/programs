# Can we re-construct a b-tree with inorder & preorder traversal sequences?
    => Yes, inorder tells (left subtree) root (right subtree).
    => Preorder tells root, left, right. Using preorder seq, find if a node lies in left or right.

# Inorder traversal of a Binary Search Tree yields a sorted sequence
# BST can be re-constructed from
    => Pre OR Post order (we know the root) using the fact that left node < root < right node
    => Can't from Inorder as we don't know the root
