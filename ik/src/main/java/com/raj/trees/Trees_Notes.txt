# Can we re-construct a b-tree with inorder & preorder traversal sequences?
    => Yes, inorder tells (left subtree) root (right subtree).
    => Preorder tells root, left, right. Using preorder seq, find if a node lies in left or right.

# Inorder traversal of a Binary Search Tree yields a sorted sequence
# BST can be re-constructed from
    => Pre OR Post order (we know the root) using the fact that left node < root < right node
    => Can't from Inorder as we don't know the root

# Passing object ptrs to a method is pass by value (meaning the reference is copied & passed over),
so changing object vars will be permanent, but changing the object ptr won't be visible outside the method.

    => This is important to remember otherwise unexpected thongs will happen like when we pass a prev Tree.Node ptr
    and re-assign it in the helper method, it won't be visible. Hence, consider making them static if u need them to be
    permanent or create a class for it.
