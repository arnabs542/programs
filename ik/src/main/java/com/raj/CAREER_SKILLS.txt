=== BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS ===
# Interviewer is looking for red flags on these questions

# Pattern of Likability:
  - Curious
  - Humility
  - Hard Work
  - Conscientiousness

  - Showing Enthusiasm
  - Passion to learn new things/tech
  - Ownership
  - Collaboration with Team
  - Independent & wise decision-making despite ambiguity
  - Extraordinarily candid/truthful with each other

# S.T.A.R. Method:
  - Answer most questions by:
    * Situation - describe it
    * Task - the task performed
    * Action - you took
    * Result - achievements / impact

# Tell me about yourself:
  - 1 min pitch w/ highlights
  - Start w/ most recent projects & then go back
  - End w/ what u are looking for

# Recognizing Tone from "Tell me about X questions":
  - A difficult situation / Weakness / Area of Improvement - Remain neutral, very subtle sell, describe lesson learnt
  - A interesting/challenging project / strengths / tell me abt yourself - Sell yourself

# Direct Questions:
  - First answer the question than give too much details. Then add detail, if interviewer is interested.

# Describe CHALLENGING PROJECT(s):
  [For each of ur company(maybe they are interested in particular company or domain) prepare few projects]
  * Most technically challenging project
    - Rollups scratch
    - Dedupe Storm
    - Rollups revamp incremental
    - Ads Item Store caching: Real time streaming+batch pipeline
    - Composite Vector Embedding Data Pipeline
    - SBA enhancements
  * Most situationally challenging project
    - Timeline changes, resource & time constraints, conflicting priorities
    - Don't talk abt individuals
  * Struggled & Lesson learnt
    - Failed at first, then learnt/improvised & succeeded later

  * OWNERSHIP / SCRATCH DEV / SCALE
    - ROLLUPS
    - One man army until team was expanded
    - Started with POC working with Distinguished Eng
    - Built from scratch new Tier-1 service for pre-computing cacheable Search data / Publishing / Ranking Offers
    - Event Driven Async Processing w/ Ingestion + Read facing services. 50ms SLA scaled upto 500K qps

  * SITUATIONALLY CHALLENGING / PROACTIVE
    - STORM DE-DUPE TOPO
    - Lags were increasing over time as catalog+MP seller offers expanded
    - Too many dupes(seller price uploads, Smart Pricing feeds) arising from same triggers(why trigger? business rules hence IRO call) from microservices
    - Storm Distributed Grouping to club similar item level events into 5 mins/100 message + discard dupes
    - Achieved over 25% processing speed in general & more than 2X processing in burst events.

  * TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING / NEW DOMAIN + CODEBASE / IMPACT
    - ADS ITEMSTORE
    - Quickly Learnt Ads Domain + Landscape. Data analysis to understand the bottlenecks.
    - After joining Sponsored Product Ads Team, was entrusted with the task to help optimize response times for Midas
    serving API(s), especially when we were heading into Holidays and it was crucial for our serving layer to be as fast
    as possible.
    - The major challenges included how do we reduce latencies from dependencies(IRO was the most time taking) & solve
    the exponential problem with Geo items whose availability was and based on zip codes. I was able to propose a solution
    which was linear in terms of growth of items & zip code combination as well as prove it through POC that it will work.
    Owned the solution E2E and collaborated with IRO, Supply Chain Teams to integrate & launch the solution in Prod well
    before Holiday freeze period. Built jobs to compare the data accuracy, optimized the storm ingestion pipeline & built
    pluggable read library for Blitzcrank to achieve:
      1. Data Accuracy of Blitz item serving cache with IRO 99.9%+
      2. Almost eliminated the need to call IRO, thereby cutting down the latency for Item Lookups by ~90% & Midas APIs by ~50%
      3. During Holiday Stress Tests, this solution helped Midas hit stress test peaks TPS of ~30K as we were serving faster and with higher throughput
      4. The platform is so robust & de-coupled such that our Midas APIs were working even when IRO had issues during stress tests due to Pricing service.
      5. Socialized and guide Personalization & PBB teams towards a similar solution for their serving needs, leveraging our generic reusable Blitzcrank components.

  * LEADING Team / MENTORING
    - JEEVES Orchestrator for Ads Item Data
    - After successful rollout of ItemStore project, more folks on Personalization/Display Ads etc were interested in using it.
    - Worked with couple of folks from IDC, was fully accountable for delivery.
    - Helped them ramp up, code reviews, get SRCR process to get endpoint outside WMT network, new capacity, assembly etc.

  * LEAD / CROSS FUNCTIONAL / TIME & RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS / TIMELINE CHANGES / CONFLICTING PRIORITIES
    - NEXTDAY Initiative
    - Worked with multiple teams ranging from SupplyChain, Catalog, P13N, CBB & FE(Search/ItemPage)
    - POC for issues, changes etc, Delivered E2E features sometimes working against time constraints/resource constraints
    - Led 3 junior folks which were allocated for this initiative

  * CURIOSITY / PASSION / HELPING TEAM / RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS
    - COMPOSITE VECTOR(128 bit Query + 32 bit Taxonomy) EMBEDDING
    - Worked with DataScience to implement, when the only contributor was OOO. Learnt Ruby codebase.
    - Suggested improvements to do delta writes to C*
    - A/B Test Framework enhancement to use config based weights
    - Passion to learn & helping team in times of need
    - You learn rapidly and eagerly
    - You contribute effectively outside of your specialty

  * LEAD / OWNERSHIP
    - SEARCH BRAND AMPLIFIER
    - Premium placement on top of Search Page that amplifies Brand w/ min $2 cost per click bids(performance)
    - Working with Product & Manager to create Quarterly Plan
    - Opportunity to go from 3M to 30M in profits.
    - Launched Category Bidding / Negative Keywords / Relevancy Improvements(Product R2D2 Taxonomy Improvements) plus Hybrid Keyword+Category Bids.

  * CONFLICT
    - Use of MySQL vs Cassandra for Caching. Data to show smaller data set cud be done by MySQL, used C* for more data heavy ops.
    - Apache Flink use for real time streaming use, but agreed to use of Storm given timelines/expertise/adoption within team.
    - CR conflict, back & forth, yielded to a certain way, but failed for an edge case in Prod. Learnt to stay course.
    - Jeeves work w/ IDC junior team. She wasn't happy about doing anything other than coding like deploys, following processes etc.
      Explained to her the importance of everything & learning these skills to independently own full SDLC later.

  * REGRETS
    - Category Bid vs Keyword could have been Hybrid from get go.

# Why leave?
