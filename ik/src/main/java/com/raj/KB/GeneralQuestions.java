 * # How to make class Immutable Java?
 *   - Declare class & members private & final (assign value in constructor)
 *     private final Integer field;
 *     constructor(val) field = val; // assigned once, can't be changed later
 *   - No setters, only getters, return a copy/deep clone of objects like arrayList
