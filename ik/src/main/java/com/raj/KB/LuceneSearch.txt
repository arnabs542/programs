# How does Lucene Search works?

"Lucene creates a big index. The index contains word id, number of docs where the word is present, and the position of
the word in those documents. So when you give a single word query it just searches the index (O(1) time complexity).
Then the result is ranked using different algorithms. For multi-word query just take the intersection of the set of files
where the words are present. Thus Lucene is very very fast."

For Example:
You want to build a search engine. The world consists of several documents containing words. When entering a textual
query (several keywords) we would like to get a sorted list of documents in return - the ones that are most relevant to the query.

Let's look at a sample corpus of five documents:
My sister is coming for the holidays.
The holidays are a chance for family meeting.
Who did your sister meet?
It takes an hour to make fudge.
My sister makes awesome fudge.

What does Lucene do? Lucene is a full text search library.
Search has two principal stages: indexing and retrieval.

During indexing, each document is broken into words, and the list of documents containing each word is stored in a list
called the "postings list".

The posting list for the word "My" is:
My --> 1,5
And the posting list for the word "fudge" is:
fudge --> 4,5
The index consists of all the posting lists for the words in the corpus.
Indexing must be done before retrieval, and we can only retrieve documents that were indexed.

Retrieval is the process starting with a query and ending with a ranked list of documents. Say the query is [my fudge].
(The brackets denote the borders of the query). In order to find matches for the query, we break it into the individual
words, and go to the posting lists. The full list of documents containing the keywords is [1,4,5]. Because document 5
contains both words and documents 1 and 4 contain just a single word from the query, a possible ranking is: 5, 1, 4
(document 5 appears first, then document 4, then document 1).

In general, indexing is a batch, preprocessing stage, and retrieval is a quick online stage, but there are exceptions.

This is the gist of Lucene. The rest of Lucene is (many important) specific bells and whistles for the indexing and retrieval processes.
