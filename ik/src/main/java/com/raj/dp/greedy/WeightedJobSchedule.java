     * Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.

     * Start Time
     * Finish Time
     * Profit or Value Associated (>= 0)
     * Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.
     *
     * Number of Jobs n = 4
     *        Job Details {Start Time, Finish Time, Profit}
     *        Job 1:  {1, 2, 50}
     *        Job 2:  {3, 5, 20}
     *        Job 3:  {6, 19, 100}
     *        Job 4:  {2, 100, 200}
     * Output: The maximum profit is 250. We can get the maximum profit by scheduling jobs 1 and 4.
     *
     * Note that there is longer schedules possible Jobs 1, 2 and 3 but the profit with this schedule is 20+50+100 which is less than 250.
     * Hence, Greedy Activity Selection Strategy to maximize Number of tasks wonâ€™t work here as a schedule with more jobs
     * may have smaller profit or value.
