# How do we know it's a DP problem? How do we solve it?
  => Look for following words: min/max, num counts/ways, 0-sum game etc
  => Has overlapping sub-problem property
  => Understanding what smaller sub-problem exists from where u can build the next one & finally the solution
  => Core of a DP problem is underlying the recurrence relation, farming the DP formula with base cases
