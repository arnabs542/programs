=== Walmart Labs ===
>>> Major Initiatives - Catalog Tech:
# Joined Walmart at the time when Pangaea was at it's inception stage. Worked for over more than 4 yrs building highly
scalable & responsive Restful APIs & data ingestion pipelines for micro services such as Item Rollups / Item Read
Orchestrator / Offer & Product that form the core back-end for the current Pangaea Platform. These microservices are
able to handle peak loads of millions of transactions per minute with sub-second latencies. Worked on innovative
pre-computational & real time algorithms to speed up search & lookup responses. The new platform has been a key enabler
for scaling up our eCommerce Item Catalog from 2 MM to 200MM+ and Marketplace sellers from double digits numbers to more
than 4 digits & continues to expand everyday.

# Built Rollups service - an aggregation service built to pre-compute data and speed up IRO lookups - from scratch &
completely owned and delivered business initiatives for initial few years. Also built a real time storm pipeline to
dedupe messages across different incoming streams to enhance throughput.
Got Patent for unique methodology / Awards / Exceeds ratings / Promo for ownership & quality deliverables.

# As a Lead engineer, I led Item Rollups, Product & Offer store through major initiatives like Project Skywalker(bringing
us a step closer towards unified item setup & catalog for Walmart, Jet, Hayneedle etc), Online Grocery, 2-Day Shipping etc.

# Some other initiatives -
 -> OfferStore 2.0 - Arhitected a design towards simplifying current system so as to relieve the bottlenecks seen during
 peak ingestion / serving times. Came up with merged nsf/sf data models to achieve 50% lesser storage & writes, faster
 reads, more maintainable code with huge reduction in number of API's, better tracking with Centralized Audit system &
 faster ingestion processing with async flows.
 -> Worked on NextGen Rollups processing framework which would incrementally merge states from incoming Kafka messages
 and reduce the need for calling other microservices which slows down processing, thereby reducing lags.

>>> Major Initiatives - Ads Tech (WPA):
# Blitzcrank aka 'Ads ItemStore cache' - After joining WPA, was entrusted with the task to help optimize response times
for Midas serving API(s), especially when we were heading into Holidays and it was crucial for our serving layer to be
as fast as possible. The major challenges included how do we reduce latencies from dependencies(IRO was the most time
taking) & solve the exponential problem with Geo items whose availability was and based on zip codes. I was able to
propose a solve which was linear in terms of growth of items & zip code combination as well as prove it through POC that
it will work. Owned the solution E2E and collaborated with IRO, Supply Chain Teams to integrate & launch the solution in
Prod well before Holiday freeze period. Built jobs to compare the data accuracy, optimized the storm ingestion pipeline
& built pluggable read library for Blitzcrank to achieve:
1. Data Accuracy of Blitz item serving cache with IRO 99.9%+
2. Almost eliminated the need to call IRO, thereby cutting down the latency for Item Lookups by ~90% & Midas APIs by ~50%
3. During Holiday Stress Tests, this solution helped Midas hit stress test peaks TPS of ~30K as we were serving faster and with higher throughput
4. The platform is so robust & de-coupled such that our Midas APIs were working even when IRO had issues during stress tests due to Pricing service.
5. Socialized and guide Personalization & PBB teams towards a similar solution for their serving needs, leveraging our generic reusable Blitzcrank components.

# Next Day WPA initiative - completely owned and drove E2E feature implementation for ND Ads. Enhanced Blitz caching to
serve Next Day geo availability information. Proactively, resolved issues and fine tuned performance to beat the SLA requirements.
# Display Ads API - built api to get ad item info for WMX Display Ads team using existing midas-Blitzcrank caches. This
enabled Display Ads to show dynamic price & availability info for their Ads. This later evolved into a new service.
# Optimized BuyBox Ads lookup by sourcing the Anchor Item data for all catalog items from PBB, Uber Hive tables into
Cassandra. Also, made cache lookups async & faster by removing dependency on IRO calls.

# Worked on Keyword service feature to lookup BuyBox Winning seller via using light weight Blitzcrank Item Seller lookup
cache. This would help with increasing AdSpend by provide most accurate Ads without incurring any additional latency.

# Working on enhancing Blitz caching solution for Grocery which would help us push more Ads modules on Online Grocery.

# SBA Lead - Premium brand ads module on Search. Major initiatives like Category Bidding, Phrase & Broad Match. In-mem
integer indexed based search using KMP substr match. $30M target from $5M - doing $60k/day.
