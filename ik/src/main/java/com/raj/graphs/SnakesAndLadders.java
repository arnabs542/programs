     * Find the minimum number of die rolls necessary to reach the final cell of the given Snakes and Ladders board game.
     * Player starts from cell one, rolls a die and advances 1-6 (random number of) steps at a time. Should they land on
     * a cell where a ladder starts, player immediately climbs up that ladder. Similarly, having landed on a cell with a
     * snakeâ€™s mouth, player goes down to the tail of that snake. Game ends when the player arrives at the last cell.
     *
     * Sample Input 1:
     * n = 20, moves = [-1, 18, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 2, -1, -1, 15, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
     * Output = 2
     * Having started from cell 1, player rolls 1 and moves to cell 2. The stair takes them from cell 2 to cell 19.
     * They then roll 1 to arrive to the last, 20th cell. No fewer die rolls can bring a player to the last cell.
     *
     * Sample Input 2:
     * n = 8, moves = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
     * Output = 2
     * There are several ways to reach the last cell in two rolls: 6+1, 5+2, 4+3, 3+4, 2+5, 1+6.

     * 1> u need x to win but roll of dice is greater than x?
     * 2> from a cell, any roll of dice takes you to snake and u go backward (there is no way to move forward)?
     *
     * Runtime = O(n)
     * Aux Space = O(n) for visited arr & 6*n for max Q size(which is O(n) as well). But in practice, processing each
     * node adds at most 6 new nodes to the Q, and no one node is processed more than once so it's size is constant.
