=== Design Elevator System ===

Direction : UP
Cur Floor : 4
Manager   : 6,8,3,5,5,2 (order in which floors are requested)
UP  Queue : 5,6,8  (Queue w/ some priority => MinHeap)
DN  Queue : 3,2    (MaxHeap)
=> Now, elevator will stop at floors 5,6,8

# ElevatorManager (@OneToMany Elevator - can handle multiple elevators)
  - Elevator[] elevators
  - handleFloorRequest()
  - AssignmentStrategy

* Pressing from inside or outside has the same effect, elevator stops. So we can treat it same.

=> Elevator manager can handle cases such as:
* If Elevator is going UP & a higher floor requested than current, it will assign request to UP Queue & continue moving UP
* If Elevator is going UP & a lower floor requested, it will assign request to DOWN Queue & continue moving UP
* If Elevator is going UP & a lower floor requested, it will assign request to DOWN Queue & continue moving UP
* Any button press from inside will assign to the UP or DN Queue of this elevator only.
* Handles dupes of same floor request from inside or outside
* If it has a pool of elevators, then can intelligently handle requests based on strategy
* LoadBalance strategy will assign request in a round robin fashion(most easy)
* EnergySaveOptimalMode may be tricky but will take care of multiple parameters like:
  -> Direction of the elevator  (more weight)
  -> Distance from the requested floor
  -> WeightSoFar
  -> Is the elevator going UP & the request is for UP from a nearby floor, give priority (but discard if the weightLimit is almost near)
  -> Queue.size()
  -> It can assign some weight to each of these parameter, score for each elevator & then do optimal routing of request to the elevator's UP/DN Queue


# Elevator Manager
  - Elevators[]
  - AssignmentStrategy {LoadBalance,Random,EnergySaveOptimalMode,QuickDispatch,PreferentialFloor} ... Strategy Pattern
  - assign_floor_requests() using FIFO Queue & depending on strategy
  - setElevatorStatus(elevator_id)

# Direction {UP,DN}

# Request
  - int Floor

# Elevator
  - id
  - UPPriorityQueue
  - DNPriorityQueue
  - Direction
  - State {OutOfOrder,Repair,Working}
  - processRequest(Request)
  - int weightLimit
  - alarmIfWeightOverLimit()
  - speed
  - setSpeed()
  - open/close door()
  - callEmergency()
  - stop()

REST APIs:
GET /elevators                  ... list of all elevators
POST /elevators/{id}            ... add an elevator
PUT /elevators/{id}/{state}     ... take elevator out of order
DELETE /elevators/{id}          ... remove an elevator

PUT /elevators/request/{floor}/{direction}       ... outside summon, elevator manager assigns which elevator
PUT /elevators/{id}/request/{floor}              ... inside press
