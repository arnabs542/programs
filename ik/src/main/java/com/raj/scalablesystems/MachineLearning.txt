Some excerpts:

Machine learning - The high level and most commonly accepted definition is: machine learning is the ability for computers
to learn and act without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised learning is when you have knowledge of the input (X) and the output (Y), then you “supervise” the program in
predicting the right outcome via trial and error.

Unsupervised learning is when you have zero knowledge of the output and you want to try to find patterns or groupings
within the data. Think clustering.

Deep Learning uses neural network & uses millions of datapoints to make a decision unlike ML which does few thousands.
It has been doing extremely well is that Neural Networks have been proven to be an Universal Function Approximater,
meaning that it can approximate any function between X or Y- given enough data of course.
