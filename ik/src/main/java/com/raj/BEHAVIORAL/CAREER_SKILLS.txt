# STRENGTHS
  * Ownership & Dedication
  * Passionate abt new Tech/Domain & Quick Learner
  * Honest, Humble & Flexible
  * Self motivated & Positive in pressing situations
  * Tech Stack
    "Building WebServices & Scalable Distributed Systems"
  * Tech leadership
    "With more than 14 years of experience in internet scale systems, I’ve exceeded my OKRs & KPIs every quarter and have been
    promoted twice in the past five years. I look back at those successes and know that I wouldn’t have reached them if
    I hadn’t learnt new skills, built and led teams composed of highly skilled and diverse individuals. I’m proud of my
    ability to get cross-functional groups on the same page. I’ve regularly honed my leadership skills through 360 reviews
    and candid sessions with my team, and I know continuing to build my leadership skills is something I want from my next role."
  * Team Collaboration skills
    "I’m very collaborative and have always preferred to work in groups. I work well to inspire diverse team members and work side by side with them to achieve the project goals."
  * Attentive & Listening to others
    "Empathetic person who is skilled at relating to people and understanding their needs. Regularly see this reflected in my peer and management feedback"
  * Good Problem Solver / Good Communicator / Conflict Resolver
    "I think one of my greatest strengths is as a problem solver. I have the ability to see a situation from different
    perspectives and I can get my work done even in the face of difficult obstacles. My communication skills are top-notch.
    I feel just as comfortable presenting solutions to senior management as I do mediate a conflict between junior team members."
  * Strong work ethic
    "When I commit to a deadline, I do whatever it takes to deliver. For example, last week we had a report due and got
    some data back late from our team in IDC. I pulled an all-nighter to finish the job query because I had committed for a timely delivery."
  * Taking initiatives & risks
    "Throughout my career I've taken calculated risks & not been afraid of failures. I keep improvising on lessons learnt"

# WEAKNESS
[Tech]
  * Code reviews
    Wasn't good at doing CR or Scala/ML/ELK tech stack, took online classes & learnt
  * Scala Functional Prog / ML / DS
    Wasn't good at BigData & DS concepts, took courses & did some projects
  * Not too detail-oriented
    Early on, was doing things just to get by, learnt the importance of deep diving even if knowledge isn't needed right away
[WLB]
  * Between work & personal life priorities, I keep choosing work or take work too seriously
  * Struggle to prioritize when backlogged with a lot of work & many new tasks/distractions keep coming in
    "When new projects come across my plate, I sometimes jump right into those projects and halt work on the projects I had in progress. Having to jump between tasks, so many times throughout the day hinders my productivity and prevents me from delivering my best work. I have been using a to-do reminders to help me manage my tasks and my time, which has helped me become more aware of prioritization."
  * Wasn't good at multitasking but doing better w/ assigning priority, time slotting & delegation
[Soft Skills]
  * Self critical
    "A pattern I’ve noticed throughout my career is that I often feel I could have done more, even if objectively, I did well.
    Earlier in my career, this led to burnout and negative self-talk.
    One solution I’ve implemented over the last three years is to actively pause and celebrate my achievements.
    Not only has this helped my own self-esteem, but it has also helped me genuinely appreciate and recognize my contrib & impact"
  * Somewhat Shy, Not adept at public speaking / presentation skills
    "From high school and into my early professional career, it prevented me from speaking up.
    Did mentorship w/ leaders, toastmasters & learned practical skills around leading discussions and sharing diverse perspectives.
    Now, in group settings, I always start conversations with the quieter folks. I know exactly how they feel, and people can be amazing once they start talking."
  * Difficulty asking help from others / Take on too much responsibility / Wanting to control too many aspects of a situation
    "I default to believing that I can solve any problem on my own. This works well in some situations, but in many cases,
    I need the help of others to overcome factors beyond my control. In my earliest design project I was looking into components that had a lot of moving parts.
    It wasn’t until after the delivery that I realized how narrowly I had pulled it off. I was trying to manage everything
    from the E2E design down to the tiniest details. I did a lot of self-reflection afterward.
    Since then, I’ve been training myself to take a step back before diving into problem-solving mode and identify people or groups that can be help to me.”
  * Procrastinator - delaying things to last minute in fear of failures
    "It was creating last minute stress for myself. When I was working for AMZ several years ago, I was on a group project
    where I could see how my putting things off to the last minute created stress for everyone else. It was a wake-up call.
    I started creating daily to-dos that hold me accountable to my work, and I broke the habit. It was hard at first,
    but using the Agile/Scrum process was a real breakthrough in my workflow and mindset."
  * Disorganized - used TODOs
  * Not optimistic always & losing hope sometimes after many tries - learn to be patient
[PEOPLE SKILLS]
  * Believe others too easily, too honest, not too sophisticated
  * Too caring to others and their needs than my own needs first
  * Not very strict about anything or any situation
  * Not good at keeping secrets
  * Bringing emotions into thinking/decision sometimes

# What's your leadership style?
  * "Lead by example & open communication" - I like taking lead on projects, but I also like to stay involved and inspire
  my team by showing that I’m working hands-on to help them, too. For example, we had an emergency situation where a our
  Ad revenue was zero due to tech issue. To break chaos, I quickly setup call to break down areas of work each one available
  can work on(delegation), informed clients about the outage & some ETA, got on the phone with the infra folks myself to find out
  more information for my team while they worked at granular level. Stopped non-critical usecases to run in degraded but available
  mode to make the issue less costly while we came up with a permanent solution. When my team saw me working hard to fix this,
  it made them realize the importance of the issue and work hard as well. Taking more time to communicate effectively at
  the beginning of the task, and delegating properly, both end up saving time.

# Tell me about a time when you performed WELL under STRESS / PRESSURE / DEADLINE ?
  * My coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished
  * My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline. I had an on-going project deliverable also.
  * Took the problem head on & Put in extra hours + weekends to understand code & achieve the deadline learning new things on the way
  * My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive & later attributed this factor for my exceeds ratings in annual appraisal.
  * In an another instance as TL for a project deliverable, challenged team members to work overtime. As a reward promised two days of extra PTO time & free Happy Hour.
  * eg. [IC] Vector pipeline project, Adrian was OOO.
  * eg. [TL] ND site work, OfferStore revamp, Azure migration

# Tell me about a time you had a CONFLICT at work & RESOLUTION ?
  [Conflicts happen. Talk about method of handling conflict not about details of outcome]
  * There was a disagreement with a coworker which originated from a miscommunication.
  * To keep our work environment professional and positive, we had to discuss it and make amends.
  * I sat down with them one day during lunch, paid for their meal, and took initiative by apologizing for my part in the whole mess. They also apologized for slacking off.
  * Now, we work together well and are help each other in times of need.
  [More Deep Dive on Resolution]
  * Address the root cause of the conflict, be humble, accept any shortcomings on ur part
  * Keep asking the right questions
  * Discuss b/w conflicting parties
  * Data gathering(pros & cons), consensus building, choose one that best fits the situation/deadline
  * eg. Java vs Scala post Polymorph acquisition & merging of stacks

# Tell me about a time you had a DIRECT CONFRONTATION / ANGER with team member / RESOLVE DISAGREEMENT within team ?
  [STAR]
  * Our new manager had a single design approach that wasn't working for everyone and members of our team were getting
  frustrated and felt they were being micro-managed. I suggested that I sit down one-on-one with our manager, having heard
  the frustrations of the team. I avoided us all sitting down because I didn't want her to feel ganged up on and become defensive.
  After talking, we decided that they would let team members know their door was open if they needed help & would let them
  be in charge of the strategy they used to meet their goals. We also started doing monthly Sprint retro meetings & have
  supervisor too join in to what worked well & what didn't work/concerns devs had & talk about how do we address them.
  [Deep Dive on resolution strategy]
  * Invited the team member out for coffee to talk about what happened and how I could help. My approach focused on
  "how can we fix this in the future" rather than on the many ways the co-worker messed up. I was glad I took the time
  to chill out since it turned out my co-worker was dealing with serious personal health issues and unforgiving deadlines
  from several other projects.
  * I always try to avoid CONFRONTATION, in both my personal and professional life. This caused me to compromise sometimes
  on the quality of my work or what I needed to complete a project just to keep the peace. This became a real problem when
  I became a team leader. One of the most critical aspects of leading people is telling them what they need to hear and
  not what they want to hear. I recognized this weakness and had been actively working to voice my opinions constructively
  and helpfully for the betterment of the team.
  * I don’t think ANGER is an appropriate workplace emotion. I have dealt with situations that I found frustrating;
  for example, I had a coworker who was very confrontational in her written and oral communication. I felt like I was
  constantly being criticized for things beyond my control. I sat down with her and talked about ways that we could improve
  our communication. After having that calm, productive conversation, our relationship as co-workers improved greatly,
  and we actually became collaborators on a number of successful projects.
  * ANGER to me means loss of control. I don't lose control. When I get stressed, I step back, take a deep breath,
  thoughtfully think through the situation and then begin to formulate a plan of action. For instance, when I am given
  multiple projects to complete in a short amount of time, I come up with a strategy for how to complete the work in a
  steady, methodical manner that will not overwhelm me.
  [Handle disagreements on your team]
  * My goal is to facilitate discussion and help my team find compromise when there is a disagreement.
  * In my role, two of my team members had different approaches to completing their part of the project.
  * I let each side explain what their thought process was and what benefits they saw in their method.
  * I encouraged respectful discussion and positive commentary.
  * After each side outlined their arguments, I helped them brainstorm the ways in which both arguments could become a combined solution.
  * This process enabled these team members work together and see each other’s perspectives. It also helped them remember that they both were working toward the same goal and should collaborate on the best way to complete their tasks.

# What Do People Most Often CRITICIZE About You?
  I had a supervisor many years ago tell me that I was too critical of other people’s work. I took that to heart and made
  sure from that point forward that my analysis and suggestions were always supportive and helpful rather than critical.
  More recently, people have praised my ability to give thoughtful and useful feedback.

# Tell me about a MISTAKE / REGRETS / DONE DIFFERENTLY at work ?
  * We rolled out a new feature release to Prod and things weren't working as expected, impressions were down for some of modules
  * I was actually the one who discovered my mistake first. When I did, I was able to figure out how it happened and what needed to be done about it.
  * With a plan in hand, I talked to my supervisor and asked that I be responsible for fixing the mistake
  * Informed consumers of service about the issue, revenue impact & ETA of fix w/ formal apology through email
  * Fortunately, this was caught soon enough that very limited impact occurred. I fixed it before given ETA.
  * I learned to pay close attention to the verification, testing all scenarios & importance of E2E regression tests which were minimal & revamped it.
  * Added Regression scenario based testing step to Jenkins build & fail build if it didn't pass.
  * Customers & my supervisor appreciated the effort to being forthcoming & make the situation right in timely manner.
  * eg. (Early days, deploy systems not mature enough + human error)
    + Deploy with default 2GB RAM on XL boxes, worked with OneOps to fix this by creating P2 Support ticket.
    + Restart service without selecting % deploy which defaulted to 100%, got it addressed w/ high DC availability reasoning.
    + Relax CL level for C* reads to Local_One on nsf to solve load issues, but later had issues with Consistency. Should have asked for more capacity than cut corners.

  * Things didn't go expected after a release due to shortcomings in the understanding of some tech/domain.
  * Took a step back, worked on a plan to upgrade skills, increase your knowledge base, document learnings,
  * Took workshop to modify counterproductive behaviors & seek advice from mentors
  * Now I won't make those mistakes again.

# Tell me about a FAILED GOAL / HANDLE FAILURES ?
  [how you handle disappointment and failure - you set a huge goal, didn't achieve it, took responsibility and learned from the experience]
  * I was working on a start-up where our goal was to create better way to upload online video content.
  * We polled our audience and tried many different ideas, but after a year we had to move on. However, I learned so much from the process.
  * I developed numerous skills and realized I'm incredibly good at shifting direction when something isn't working. I realized I don't let defeats discourage me for long.

# Tell me about a time you made a UNPOPULAR DECISION / PROCESS and explain how you handled it?
  [We have to make difficult decisions that aren't popular with all team members]
  * Saw issues during new deploys so setup a dev process to get 2 CR approvals before merging commits otherwise can't merge
  * Also added mandatory Mgr CRQ approval w/ details about change - rollback, version, DC, deploy time, customer impact etc
  * Developers disliked it as it slowed down the code pushes & deploy cycle
  * Presented data from last 1 year where most site facing or revenue impacting issues were encountered during new deploys & was crucial to tradeoff some time to get NoOp releases.

# Tell me about a time where you were able to MOTIVATE TEAM MEMBER / CO-WORKER NOT DELIVERING?
  * I noticed that one of new team member was having a hard time meeting their Sprint task deadlines.
  * I suggested we find time over the next day or two and I would show them some practices I was using that I found highly effective.
  * Understood their situation, mostly it looked like they were overwhelmed with new domain & new language & tech stack.
  * Mentored them, gave them extensive 1:1 knowledge session from High Level to code level, shared notes, links, tools and it worked! After a a month or so, they were consistently hitting story timelines.

  * Follow up with my coworker by email or Slack, and if that didn’t work I’d check in with him personally. If the
  problem grew to a point where it was going to be detrimental to the project, I’d ask a supervisor for an assist.

# Tell me about how you SET GOALS / MEASURE SUCCESS / PROJECT STAY ON SCHEDULE ?
  [Discuss an ambitious goal you set for yourself and how you came up with a plan for to achieve it & how you measure success]
  * Wanted to learn new language/tech stack. Created schedule to spend 4 hrs/week to achieve it.
  * Set KPI as building a small website on AWS using it.
  * Discussed w/ manager to even set it as my personal OKR & sought their advice to achieve it.
  * Researched online materials to study & after few weeks of disciplined efforts, I was able to knock off this as a new skill.
  * My supervisor gave me a project later to use my recent learning.
  [SMART Method - Used it for personal goal management]
  * Specific - Short term & narrow scope
  * Measurable - How are u tracking success?
  * Attainable - within a certain time-frame
  * Relevant - goals shud align with ur values/long term goals/company goals
  * Time-Based - End date w/ checkpoints
  [TEAM Project]
  * When my team is assigned a collaborative project, I always begin by discussing the project’s objective and purpose.
  * Then, I assign each team member individual tasks and deadlines. I find that when the team knows the goals of the overall project, they can better see how their role impacts the project’s success.
  * When we work on a project, I hold full team meetings to allow individual team members to share their progress. I try to celebrate the team’s hard work to keep them motivated.
  * I also check with each team member to see their progress, address any risks or deadline issues and provide additional clarity. Checking in outside of the group meeting can make team members feel more comfortable sharing if they need extra help.
  * I find that the process of remaining available to my team and encouraging their success allows them to stay focused and feel supported.

# Tell me about a OVERCOME A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE ?
  * During one of my team’s recent projects, we were approaching the deadline but were not making the progress we needed to meet our goal.
  * Many team members were feeling overwhelmed, and the pressure was affecting their work quality. I took on a number of tasks and worked alongside them to meet the deadline.
  * My team felt supported knowing I was taking on additional responsibilities so they did not have to compromise the quality of their work.
  * We completed the project on time.
  * In retrospect, I realized that our timeline and workload were not realistic. In the future, I will spend more time analyzing the initial planning process and discussing realistic expectations. I want to make sure my team stays motivated, so spending more time before beginning the project can help me better delegate tasks.

# What's your PROJECT MANAGEMENT STYLE ?
  * Waterfall / Traditional - One big bang start to end approach, steps are dependent like requirenemnts -> design -> impl -> test -> UAT -> stage -> prod
  * Agile / Iterative - Small sprints to deliver incremental features w/ product prioritization or backlog with acceptance criteria, plan, daily scrum, deploy & retro.
    - Basic viable product ready sooner than wait months for a big bang delivery. Then iterate & improve product. Feedback to customer + active engagements.
    - Re-priority / refactor possible if requirements change (can be a drawback)

# Where do you SEE yourself in 5 YEARS?
  * Talk abt what u want to learn, the impact u want to create
  * Don't talk abt titles or moving into management, instead say learn more leadership & people management skills
  * "Hard to say how it wud be 5 yrs down the line, but I'd Improve technical acumen & leadership skills, then wherever I'm, I'll be successful & serve the company in the best possible way"

# Why leave?
  * Remain neutral about leaving, dnt talk abt bad people/managers/pay etc
  * Go Positive abt future w/ new company: Talk about learning new things, strengths of new company, its scale, products you like etc

# Why join us? research abt company & talk abt good points, projects u want to work with
  * Refrain from saying better work life balance as it sends wrong signal abt you being lazy

# Why should we hire you?
  * Talk abt strengths
  * What are they looking for?
    - Are you curios: learn new things
    - Accountable: ownership
    - Good judgement

# Follow up Questions to ask:
  * Describe culture, team, what u do, current challenges, tech stack?
  * What are u looking for in this role? What wud u want to see in an ideal candidate?
  * Can you tell me more about the day-to-day responsibilities of this job?
  * What are the biggest opportunities/challenges facing the company/department right now?
  * Is this role for a specific level or is it flexible? How is the leveling decided?
  * How does ur typical day look like?
  * What do u like abt this company / or don't like?
  * What is ur development/release process?

[Answer using STAR method, use of data driven decisions & KPI metrics to measure success]
# Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action? What was the outcome of that choice?
  * Research, asking right questions to right people, seeking diverse opinions, learning in depth about options that u overlooked(or considered in-feasible)
  * Data driven decisions, theoretical validation, POC, scaled down 1 node stage deploy with simulated customer load, metrics to prove.
  * Sync with team/boss & move forward, don't wait any longer if you are right. [Leaders are right]

# When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?
  * Research, ask right question, learn how to use data & think best for customer.

# Describe a time you took the lead on a project.
  * Revamp of Offer Service, NextDay/ SBA initiatives, Azure Cloud WCNP Migration

# What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or promote collaboration on a particular project?
  * How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
  * How wud u empower someone who is lacking accountability?
    - Conversation, remove underlying obstacle for this behavior.
  * A process that u wanted to remove?
    - Too many meetings, use of slack saves time for many, create channel for collaborate, discuss on confluence etc.


=== Amazon Principles ===
https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles

# Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.

# Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf
of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

# Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are
externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things,
we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

# Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

# Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

# Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move
them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.

# Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are
continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders
ensure that the root cause of defects are addressed.

# Think Big
Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners
for ways to serve customers.

# Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

# Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points
for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

# Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when
doing so is awkward or embarrassing. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

# Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and
anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

# Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or
exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a
decision is determined, they commit wholly.

# Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.
Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
